# Peer-graded Assignment 3: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This project is the work of __Ranxel Almario__.

## File List:
* **CodeBook.md**: describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
* **README.md**: explains the analysis files
* **har\_data\_by\_group\_activity.txt**: comma-delimited, tidy dataset that run\_analysis.R   outputs
* **run\_analysis.R**: R script that does the following: 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How to run:
1. Just download **run\_analysis.R** and put it in your R current working directory.
2. Execute "source("run\_analysis.R")" in R (without quotes).

_Note: run\_analysis.R script is created and ran in R version 3.4.2 (winx64 x64). Tested in R version 3.4.3 (winx64)._
